This is a ✒️ writing WDI.

This activity welcomes you into the house of invention. Good research starts with our values and interests. To connect
with your values and interests, you'll explore one or more of the following questions in a brainstorming, free-flowing way:

What matters to you?
What scares you or frustrates you?
What do you want to know more about?

Step 1: Get ready to invent
Find a place where you are comfortable. For some of us, this will be a quiet space. (I like to invent on my patio,
surrounded by my plants.) For others of us, this will be in a noisy space with lots of hustle and bustle, like a coffee
shop. And for some of us, it will be the space we have, not the space we'd like. But we'll make it work.

Gather your writing tools. If you've never tried voice-to-text typing, this might be a great assignment to test that.
Here are instructions for typing with your voice using Google docsLinks to an external site..

Step 2: Pick a focusing question
Choose one of the questions in the bulleted list as a starting place. It doesn't matter which one you pick.

Steps 3-5: Start brainstorming (10 minutes x 3)
Set a timer for 10 minutes.

Start brainstorming, focusing all of your attention on the focusing question you selected. Attempt to answer it by
writing down anything and everything that comes into your head. Don't do anything else during these ten minutes.

Create lists or write sentences or a mix of both. Do what works for you. This is not polished writing.

Don't censor yourself. Let your thoughts take you where they want to go.

Once the timer goes off, take a short break (2 minutes or so), and start again. You might choose to pick up where you
left off or elaborate on an idea you wrote in round 1 or start with one of the other questions in the bulleted list.

When the timer goes off, take a short break, and then do one more round.

Steps 6-7: Let your writing cool & then mine it (active time: 15 min)
Set your writing aside for an hour or two.

Then return to it and take a look. Re-read it. Mine it for hot coals. What stands out as vibrant and lively? Highlight
these things. What surprises you? Highlight these things, too.

To complete this assignment
Follow the steps above.
In the text entry box, confirm that you completed this assignment per the instructions. Also confirm that you completed
it thoughtfully. Because I asked you to write without censoring yourself, I will not collect this writing. It's for your eyes only.

Save what you discovered. You'll use it in this week's inquiry activity.



First 10 minutes - What matters to you?

- Honesty
    Honesty matters to me because I want people to trust me
    It isn't because being a good person is "right" or anything like that
- My loved ones
    I want me loved ones to be happy and healthy
    Maybe I just want this because if they weren't, it would make me sad?
    Why would it make me sad though if it didn't matter to me anyway haha
- Being a good person
    I want to add value to the world
    I want to make the world better
- Being happy
    I want to feel happy
    I don't want to be sad
- Being perceived as all of these things
    While I want to be happy and honest and good, I also want people to think those things of me
    This is entirely extrinsic
    Maybe this isn't good, I'm not sure
- Thinking of myself as all of these things
    I would like to be happy and honest and good, and I would also like to think of myself as those things
    I think that I would be sad if I didn't
- Having people like me
    I would like people to like me. If people didn't like me, I would be sad
    I would also be lonely
    Recently I went through an experience where (a large group of people all at once decided that they did not like me),
        and I struggled with it for a while. I found a small group who did like me and over time (I've learned to live
        with a small group of friends instead of a large one). It has been good, and (it was probably good for me). If
        nobody liked me though, I would be very sad and lonely.
- Being in a good relationship
    I value having a good relationship very highly.
    I go very far out of my way to make sure that my relationships are healthy. I am always honest, I don't tell
    half-truths, things like this.





This is an ❓ inquiry WDI. To be able to do this assignment, first complete WDI: ✒️ What matters to you, etc.? You'll
use what you completed there in this activity.

This activity is designed to help you identify meaningful starting points for your research by exploring your initial
ideas and discussing them with someone you know and trust. This is part of what it means to “dwell in the house of invention,” so settle in :-)

To complete this assignment
Step 1: Review Your Writing Activity Results (10 minutes)
Look over the notes and ideas you generated from WDI: ✒️ What matters to you, etc.?

Highlight or underline any ideas that spark excitement, curiosity, or strong feelings. These are your “hot coals.”

Step 2: Brainstorm Questions (15 minutes)
For each “hot coal,” write down as many questions as you can think of. These questions don’t need to be perfect or
fully formed—just capture what you’re curious about.
Aim for at least 5 questions for each idea.

TIP: Remember, these questions are just starting points. They don’t need to be perfect or final. The goal is to find a
place where you can begin exploring something that matters to you.

I've learned to enjoy having a small group of friends instead of a large one
it was probably good for me




Step 3: Choose Your Top Questions (10 minutes)
Review your list of questions and pick the ones that seem most interesting or important to you.

Write these top questions down. These are a draft of your potential starting points. But nothing is settled. Let's
continue.

Step 4: Talk to Someone You Know (20 minutes)
Choose a friend, family member, or mentor to talk to about your top questions.

Explain why these questions matter to you and ask for their thoughts or any additional questions they might have.

Take notes during your conversation. You might discover new angles or insights that you hadn’t considered. Do more
listening than talking.

TIP: Keep an open mind during your conversation—sometimes, the best ideas come from unexpected places.

Step 5: Reflection (10 minutes)
Reflect on your conversation and the feedback you received.

How did the discussion help refine, expand, or complicate your ideas?

Write a short paragraph summarizing any new thoughts or directions that emerged.

Step 6: Gather and Submit (5 minutes)
Open this Google docLinks to an external site. and add information where required. The doc asks you to share your list
of starting point questions and your paragraph-long reflection.

Save the Google doc as a pdf and submit it to this assignment.
